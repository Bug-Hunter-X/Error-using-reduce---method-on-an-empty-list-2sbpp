# Dart Reduce Method Error on Empty List

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce()` method requires at least one element in the list; otherwise, it throws an error.

## Problem

The `reduce()` method attempts to combine all elements of a list using a given function. When the list is empty, there are no elements to combine, resulting in an error.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a check to ensure the list is not empty before applying the `reduce()` method.  This can be achieved by adding an appropriate condition (e.g., checking the list's length).
